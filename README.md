# flowers-classification
this is a group project we did in class on the subject of sorting flowers by pictures and displaying more information and growing on a web page.
Here we just did the classification for 5 flowers 'rose, daisy, sun flower, tulip, dandelion' and the model results are quite good and can distinguish these 5 flowers.
This project still has many things that have not been done as originally planned.
Thank you for visiting our group project.
